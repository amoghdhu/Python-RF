Intro to Object Oriented Python:
- Classes provides a bundling data and functionality together
- Creates a new type of object
- Called __init__ method whenever class is constructed
- self() refers to bound variable
- Added a type of dictionary with set keys and values
- Used a replacement fields to fill in sentence

More on Object Oriented Python:
- Took previous code to add instances, constructors
- on() function tells you the value of the specific key
- Found alternative to let user know what value correlates to each key
- Made variables that correlated to strings
- __dict__ attribute acts as a dictionary
